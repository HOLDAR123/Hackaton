    "heading7": "Asymmetric encryption",
    "text7": " -uses a pair of keys — a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This allows for secure data exchange without worrying about the key's transmission, but the process is usually slower than symmetric encryption.",
    "heading8": "How encryption works",
    "text8": " Encryption is based on mathematical algorithms that transform the original data (plaintext) into encrypted text. A special key is required to revert the data back to its original form (decryption). The complexity of the algorithms and the uniqueness of the keys ensure protection against unauthorized access."
